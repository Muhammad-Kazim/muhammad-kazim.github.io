I am a PhD student at the University of Siegen. My advisor is [Prof. Ivo Ihrke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XW6MbmAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am interested in wave optics, imaging, and optimization for wavefront sensing and tomography.

Background
==========

I completed my Master's in Electronic Engineering from Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in February 2022. My thesis entitled "Adaptive learning of Quantum Digits," included the application of particle filtering with a novel truncated Gaussian resampler, the diagonalization of density matrices, and an adaptive measurement procedure, which improved the rate of estimation of quantum systems under certain assumptions. I also received a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, in August 2018.

Previously, I worked as an AI consultant for Endress+Hauser, Germany. The general theme of my projects involved identifying, modifying, and creating SOTA algorithms using computer vision and deep learning to automate industrial processes. One major domain was automation to preclude human intervention in quality control tasks. 

[These projects generally include literature reviews, heavy data augmentations, model selection, training/validation/testing, hyperparameter optimizations, streamlit demos, git version controlling, and docker containerization.]: <>
