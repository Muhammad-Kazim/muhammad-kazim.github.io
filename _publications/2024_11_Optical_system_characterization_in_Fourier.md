Abstract -- Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a recent technique to overcome the diffraction limit of a low numerical aperture (NA) objective lens by algorithmic post-processing of several low-resolution images. It can increase the space-bandwidth product of an optical system by computationally combining images captured under different illumination conditions. Vignetting determines the spatial extent of the bright and dark regions in the captured images. State-of-the-art analyses treat vignetting as a nuisance that needs to be reduced or excluded from algorithmic consideration using ad hoc decision rules. In contrast, this work investigates vignetting effects as a tool to infer a range of properties of the optical system. Generally, the goal of the FPM reconstruction algorithm is to achieve results that closely resemble the actual specimen at the highest resolution possible. However, as the optimization process does not necessarily guarantee a unique solution, we identify system properties that support alignment between computational predictions and empirical observations, potentially leading to a more accurate and reliable analysis. To achieve this, we characterize the individual system components of the experimental setup and compare experimental data to both, geometrical and wave optical simulations. We demonstrate that using vignetting as an analytical tool enables the modeling of the geometric and coherence properties of the optical system as evidenced by the good agreement between our simulation and experiment.
